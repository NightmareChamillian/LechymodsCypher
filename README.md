# LechymodsCypher
--> So, what in sam hell is this?
Leachymods cypher is a logic game I've come up with to keep myself entertained. It is a way of storing information, but I've never used it to actually encode any message.
--> That still doesn't make any sense.
That's because it's eaiser to explain through demonstration than it is words. 
-First, come up with three words. They have to have at least three letters, and have to
start with the letters L, E, A, C, H, Y, M, O, D, or S. By now you can probably guess where the name comes from. 
-Next, arrange them in whatever order you think would imply the most meaning. For example, if the words I came up with are "Leak", "Emeraldine", and "Lectern",
I'd probably leave them in that order, because the symmetric structure would make the most sense if it was, yknow, actually storing a cypher.
-Now, choose four numbers. They don't have to have a zero, but in order to annoy whoever discovers it, lean more towards using zeros than not. Things like 0407, 1808,
and 0030 are all examples of this.
-Next, choose one of the following semetic abjads. Which one doesn't matter- let your heart guide you

--> So, now what? 
-Congrats! You've made yourself a leachymods. I did say it was a game more than a way of encoding information. String them together. Hastily scribble them on the 
the underside of bridges in chalk. Make two hundred of them and set up e-mail accounts to automatically send them back and forth. Truly, the world is your oyster.
--> You mentioned it was a way of storing information- how would I encode or decode information with it?
-Correct. This is where the code portion of the code comes in. First, consider the words:
-The value of a word is it's length, minus three, times the corrosponding modifier that the first letter represents. For sake of brevity, you can dig through the code
to find out what means what. This rule applies for every word.
-The value of the four digit number is all the numbers added up, multiplied by the number of zeros, minus two. This means there's a lot of ways to count up
to the same number, which combined with the above rule, means you can say the same thing in a hell of a lot of different ways. Here's me counting from 0 to 5:
0111, 0110, 0223, 2020, 3201
-The value of the abjad is whatever you want it to be. Is it a multiplier to one of the word values? Does it corrospond to a text file that has phrases that in turn 
corrospond to the value of the other four numbers? Truly, it is up to you. 

--> As I mentioned, this is first and foremost a game I come up with to keep myself busy. Come up with words, choose a number and interpret it into the hash, then choose
whatever abjad I want, and lastly write out the numbers. It could pretty easily be used to actually transmit information, or point to words, and due to the variant
nature of it could be used securely, but ultimately it's a silly little something that looks cool when you write it out.
